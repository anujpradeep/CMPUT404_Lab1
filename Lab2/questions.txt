Question 1:
    You can specify a TCP socket when in initializing a socket in python is by using socket.SOCK_STREAM.

Question 2:
    client initializes the socket, server listens to the socket.

    client makes the request server responds to the request


Question 3:
    setsockopt(). SOL_SOCKET --> the level, in this case, socket level
                  SO_REUSEADDR --> the option to enable or disable reusing the same address
                  1 --> setting SO_REUSEADDR to true

    It allows us to use the same bind port for multiple sockets. 

Question 4:

conn, addr = server_socket.accept()

It returns the client socket and the IP address and port number of that socket. the client socket (conn) also contains the IP Address and port number


Question 5:
recv() is a function used to receive data from the socket and takes the Buffer size as an argument. The received data could be bigger than the buffer, so we loop through it to make sure we get everything.


Question 6:
